            Active value is <code>{{metricWrapperMethodsActive ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}}</code>. The newly configured value

          <p>
            When enabled, all methods that are woven for trace metric timing are renamed with suffix
            <code>$glowroot$metric$&lt;metric name&gt;</code>
            and a new method is generated in its place that simply calls the renamed method. The purpose of this is so
            that stack traces gathered by the profiler can see what metric timings are active, and the resulting
            profiles can be filtered in the UI by metric names. For example, a profile can be filtered
            to see only the profile of code that is executing jdbc queries. Or, even more useful, filter to see only
            the profile of code that has no metric timings, which helps to discover new bottlenecks that would be
            worth timing via capture points. <em>Changes to this setting will take effect on next JVM restart.</em>
